            <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, I am Dhruv Sharma. I recently graduated with a Bachelor of  
                Computer Science, majoring in Cyber Security, from the Royal Melbourne 
                Institute of Technology (RMIT) in Melbourne, Australia. I love everything 
                to do with technology, however my main interests are video games, programming 
                and cybersecurity related topics.

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/KeyboardSlayer7/password_manager" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Password Manager</a></h3>
                <p>
                    A master-password based password manager that stores encrypted 
                    passwords in a JSON file. The program uses the AES encryption algorithm 
                    to encrypt and decrypt passwords. The program is written in C++ and uses 
                    the OpenSSL library for encryption/decryption and nlohmann/json for 
                    handling JSON files.

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/KeyboardSlayer7/hidethedata" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PNG Steganography</a></h3>
                <p>
                    A command line program written in C, with the help of zlib, that hides text in 
                    a PNG image. The program uses the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique to 
                    hide content in the image's pixel data.

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/KeyboardSlayer7/http_server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTTP/1.1 Server</a></h3>
                <p>
                    A simple HTTP/1.1 server written in C++ that serves static files. The server 
                    supports GET requests and can server HTML and PNG image file types (as far 
                    as I know) in its current state.

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/KeyboardSlayer7/block" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DNS Proxy</a></h3>
                <p>
                    A simple DNS proxy server written in C++ that either blocks or forwards requests 
                    to a specified DNS server. The proxy parses requests from clients and checks the 
                    domain name against a blacklist. If a domain name is in the blacklist, the query 
                    is modified so that it fails to return a valid address, before it is sent 
                    to the selected DNS server.

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/KeyboardSlayer7/setup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CMake Project Generator</a></h3>
                <p>
                    A C++ terminal program that generates a CMake project structure for C++ 
                    projects. The script creates a CMakeLists.txt file and a src directory for source 
                    files. The program uses C++17's std::filesystem and nlohmann/json.
                </p>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/KeyboardSlayer7/what" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Text to HTML</a></h3>
                <p>
                    A C terminal program that converts basic Markdown content into HTML, created to 
                    make it easier for me to write and publish posts on my blog. This project is an 
                    improved version of a C++ script I had created earlier. It relies solely on the 
                    C standard library and does not use any third-party libraries or external dependencies.
