            <p>
                Hello, I am Dhruv Sharma, a 3rd year university student studying 
                Computer Science at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology 
                (RMIT) in Melbourne, Australia. I love everything to do with 
                technology, however my main interests are video games, programming 
                and cybersecurity related topics.
            </p>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/KeyboardSlayer7/password_manager" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Password Manager</a></h3>
                <p>
                    A simple master-password based password manager that stores encrypted 
                    passwords in a JSON file. The program uses the AES encryption algorithm 
                    to encrypt and decrypt passwords. The program is written in C++ and uses 
                    the OpenSSL library for encryption/decryption and nlohmann/json for 
                    handling JSON files.

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/KeyboardSlayer7/hidethedata" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PNG Steganography</a></h3>
                <p>
                    A simple program written in C, with the help of zlib, that hides text in 
                    a PNG image. The program uses the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique to 
                    hide content in the image's pixel data. This project is currently undergoing a 
                    full rewrite.

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/KeyboardSlayer7/http_server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTTP/1.1 Server</a></h3>
                <p>
                    A simple HTTP/1.1 server written in C++ that serves static files. The server 
                    supports GET requests and can server HTML and PNG image file types (AFAIK) in 
                    its current state.

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/KeyboardSlayer7/block" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DNS Proxy</a></h3>
                <p>
                    A simple DNS proxy server written in C++ that either blocks or forwards requests 
                    to a specified DNS server. The proxy parses requests from clients and checks the 
                    domain name against a blacklist. If a domain name is in the blacklist the query 
                    is modified before it is sent to the selected DNS server.

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/KeyboardSlayer7/setup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CMake Project Generator</a></h3>
                <p>
                    A simple C++ terminal program that generates a CMake project structure for C++ 
                    projects. The script creates a CMakeLists.txt file and a src directory for source 
                    files. The program uses C++17's std::filesystem and nlohmann/json.
